# Social_tree

Creation of the links page, "Social_tree". 
On this page you will have the availability of several links and you can share only 1. Those who have never placed several links on a profile, but have a character limit and do not fit all of them or there are few spaces left for other descriptions, in this "Social_Tree" you can share only 1 link and will give you access to any other link you want.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsiveness

### What I learned

This was my first project i did, when i did it i learned how use the responsiveness and semantic HTML.

```HTML
    <header></header>
    <main></main>
    <footer></footer>
```
```CSS
main {
    font-weight: 600;
    font-size: 20px;
    height: 40vh;
    width: 20vw;
    min-width: 200px;
    display: flex;
    flex-shrink: 2;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll learn more about flex, other properties and how to become a website with more accessibility.

### Useful resources

This resource helped me a lot to understand shorthand flex and how to use.
